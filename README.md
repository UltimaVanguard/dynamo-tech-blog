  One the homepage you can view the posts with the most recent shown first.

  You can also view a post and it's contents by clicking on the post title.

  You can use the navbar to go home, your dashboard, or to login/logout.

  If you try to go to the dashboard without being logged in, it redirects you to the login/signup page.

  Once logged in or signed up, you can go to your dashboard to view all of the posts you've made. From their you can update a post or delete it.

  On the post page, if you're logged in, you can add a comment to the post.

  The session information will last for a day.
